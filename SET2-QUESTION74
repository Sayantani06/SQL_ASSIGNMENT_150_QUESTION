Write an SQL query to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, 
rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for 
at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.



CREATE TABLE activity
(
  player_id INT,
  device_id INT,
  event_date DATE,
  games_played INT,
  CONSTRAINT pk_activity PRIMARY KEY(player_id, event_date)
);

INSERT INTO activity VALUES(1, 2, '2016-03-01', 5);
INSERT INTO activity VALUES(1 ,2, '2016-03-02', 6);
INSERT INTO activity VALUES(2, 3, '2017-06-25', 1);
INSERT INTO activity VALUES(3, 1, '2016-03-02', 0);
INSERT INTO activity VALUES(3, 4, '2018-07-03', 5);

With details(player_id,event_date,date_diff) as 
(Select player_id,event_date, 
datediff((lead(event_date) over(partition by player_id order by event_date)),event_date) as date_diff 
from activity),
details_1(count1) as 
(Select count(player_id) from details where date_diff=1)
Select round(((Select count1 from details_1)/(Select count(distinct(player_id)) from activity)),2) as Fraction;
