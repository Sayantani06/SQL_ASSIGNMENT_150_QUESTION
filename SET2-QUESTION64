Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all the employees for each project, 
rounded to 2 digits. 
 


CREATE TABLE employee
(
  employee_id INT,
  name VARCHAR(25),
  experience_years INT,
  CONSTRAINT pk_employee PRIMARY KEY (employee_id)
);

CREATE TABLE project
(
  project_id INT,
  employee_id INT,
  CONSTRAINT pk_project PRIMARY KEY (project_id, employee_id),
  CONSTRAINT fk_employee FOREIGN KEY (employee_id)
    REFERENCES employee(employee_id)
);

INSERT INTO employee VALUES(1, 'Khaled', 3);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(2, 'Ali', 2);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(3, 'John', 1);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(4, 'Doe', 2);

INSERT INTO project VALUES(1, 1);
INSERT INTO project VALUES(1, 2);
INSERT INTO project VALUES(1, 3);
INSERT INTO project VALUES(2, 1);
INSERT INTO project VALUES(2, 4);


SELECT P.PROJECT_ID, ROUND(AVG(E.experience_years),2)
 FROM PROJECT P JOIN EMPLOYEE E
 ON e.employee_id=P.employee_id
 GROUP BY P.PROJECT_ID;
