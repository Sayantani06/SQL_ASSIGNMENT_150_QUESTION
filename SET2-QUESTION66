write an SQL query that reports the buyers who have bought S8 but not iPhone. 
Note that S8 and iPhone are products present in the Product table. R



CREATE TABLE product
(
  product_id INT,
  product_name VARCHAR(25),
  unit_price INT,
  CONSTRAINT pk_product PRIMARY KEY (product_id)
);

CREATE TABLE sales
(
  seller_id INT,
  product_id INT,
  buyer_id INT,
  sale_date DATE,
  quantity INT,
  price INT,
  CONSTRAINT fk_product FOREIGN KEY (product_id)
    REFERENCES product(product_id)
);

INSERT INTO product VALUES(1, 'S8', 1000);
INSERT INTO product VALUES(2, 'G4', 800);
INSERT INTO product VALUES(3, 'iPhone', 1400);

INSERT INTO sales VALUES(1, 1, 1, '2019-01-21', 2, 2000);
INSERT INTO sales VALUES(1, 2, 2, '2019-02-17', 1, 800);
INSERT INTO sales VALUES(2, 1, 3, '2019-06-02', 1, 800);
INSERT INTO sales VALUES(3, 3, 3, '2019-05-13', 2, 2800);

SELECT BUYER_ID FROM  (select sales.buyer_id AS BUYER_ID , product.product_name, product.product_id,
LEAD(PRODUCT_NAME) OVER(PARTITION BY BUYER_ID ORDER BY BUYER_ID) AS NEXT_BUY
 from sales join product 
on sales.product_id =product.product_id) TEMP
WHERE PRODUCT_NAME='S8' AND (NEXT_BUY IS NULL OR NEXT_BUY<>'IPHONE');
