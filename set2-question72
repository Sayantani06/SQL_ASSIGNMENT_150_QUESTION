Write an SQL query to find for each month and country,
the number of transactions and their total amount, the number of approved transactions and their total amount.



CREATE TABLE transactions
(
  id INT,
  country VARCHAR(25),
  state VARCHAR(15),
  amount INT,
  trans_date DATE,
  CONSTRAINT pk_trx PRIMARY KEY(id)

INSERT INTO transactions VALUES(121, 'US', 'approved', 1000, '2018-12-18');
INSERT INTO transactions VALUES(122, 'US', 'declined', 2000, '2018-12-19');
INSERT INTO transactions VALUES(123, 'US', 'approved', 2000, '2019-01-01');
INSERT INTO transactions VALUES(124, 'DE', 'approved', 2000, '2019-01-07');


With approved_list(country,trans_date,amount,apr_count) as
