Write an SQL query to report the number of calls and the total call duration between each pair of 
distinct persons (person1, person2) where person1 < person2. Return the result table in any order.

CREATE TABLE calls
(
  from_id INT,
  to_id INT,
  duration INT
);

INSERT INTO calls VALUES(1, 2, 59);
INSERT INTO calls VALUES(2, 1, 11);
INSERT INTO calls VALUES(1, 3, 20);
INSERT INTO calls VALUES(3, 4, 100);
INSERT INTO calls VALUES(3, 4, 200);
INSERT INTO calls VALUES(3, 4, 200);
INSERT INTO calls VALUES(4, 3, 499);

SELECT PERSON1,PERSON2,SUM(COUNT_OF_CALLS), SUM(DURATION)FROM (SELECT
 DISTINCT FROM_ID AS PERSON1, TO_ID AS PERSON2, COUNT(FROM_ID) AS COUNT_OF_CALLS, SUM(DURATION) AS DURATION
 FROM  CALLS WHERE FROM_ID< TO_ID GROUP BY FROM_ID,TO_ID
UNION
SELECT
 TO_ID AS PERSON1,FROM_ID AS PERSON2, COUNT(FROM_ID) AS COUNT_OF_CALLS, SUM(DURATION) AS DURATION
 FROM  CALLS WHERE FROM_ID> TO_ID GROUP BY FROM_ID,TO_ID) TEMP GROUP BY PERSON1,PERSON2;
