Write an SQL query to find the salaries of the employees after applying taxes.
Round the salary to the nearest integer. The tax rate is calculated for each company based on the following criteria: 
● 0% If the max salary of any employee in the company is less than $1000. 
● 24% If the max salary of any employee in the company is in the range [1000, 10000] inclusive.
● 49% If the max salary of any employee in the company is greater than $10000. Return the result table in any order.
