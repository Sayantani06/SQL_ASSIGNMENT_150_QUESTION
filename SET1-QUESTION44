Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager. 
If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager. No employee will be the manager of themself. 
Write an SQL query to report the managers with at least five direct reports. Return the result table in any order.

CREATE TABLE employee
(
  id INT,
  name VARCHAR(30),
  department VARCHAR(30),
  manager_id INT,
  CONSTRAINT pk_employee PRIMARY KEY(id)
);

INSERT INTO employee VALUES(101, 'John', 'A', null);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(102, 'Dan', 'A', 101);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(103, 'James', 'A', 101);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(104, 'Amy', 'A', 101);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(105, 'Anne', 'A', 101);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(106, 'Ron', 'B', 101);


SELECT DISTINCT(E1.NAME) FROM EMPLOYEE E1 JOIN EMPLOYEE E2 ON E1.ID=E2.MANAGER_ID;
