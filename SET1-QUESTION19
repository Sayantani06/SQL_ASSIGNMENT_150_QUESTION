--Question: delivery_id is the primary key of this table. 
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it). If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediately; 
otherwise, it is called scheduled. Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the table, rounded to 2 decimal places.


Select (count(delivery_id)/(Select count(delivery_id) from delivery))*100 
as immediate_percentage from delivery where order_date = CUSTOMER_PREF_DELIEVERY_DATE;
