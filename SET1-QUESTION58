Write an SQL query to report all the consecutive available seats in the cinema. 
Return the result table ordered by seat_id in ascending order. 
The test cases are generated so that more than two seats are consecutively available.


CREATE TABLE cinema
(
  seat_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
  free BOOLEAN,
  CONSTRAINT pk_cinema PRIMARY KEY (seat_id)
);

INSERT INTO cinema(free) VALUES(TRUE);
INSERT INTO cinema(free) VALUES(FALSE);
INSERT INTO cinema(free) VALUES(TRUE);
INSERT INTO cinema(free) VALUES(TRUE);
INSERT INTO cinema(free) VALUES(TRUE);



With serial_number as
(Select seat_id, seat_id-lead(seat_id) over(order by seat_id) as serial1 from cinema where free=1)
Select seat_id from serial_number where serial1=-1 or serial1 is null;
