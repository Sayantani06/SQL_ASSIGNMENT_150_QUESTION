write a SQL query for a report that provides the pairs (actor_id, director_id) 
where the actor has cooperated with the director at least three times. Return the result table in any order


CREATE TABLE actor_director
(
  actor_id INT,
  director_id INT,
  timestamp INT,
  CONSTRAINT pk_actor_director PRIMARY KEY (timestamp)
);

INSERT INTO actor_director VALUES(1, 1, 0);
INSERT INTO actor_director VALUES(1, 1, 1);
INSERT INTO actor_director VALUES(1, 1, 2);
INSERT INTO actor_director VALUES(1, 2, 3);
INSERT INTO actor_director VALUES(1, 2, 4);
INSERT INTO actor_director VALUES(2, 1, 5);

INSERT INTO actor_director VALUES(2, 1, 6);


Select actor_id,director_id from
(select actor_id,director_id, 
row_number() over(partition by actor_id,director_id) as num from actor_director) temp where num=3 ;
