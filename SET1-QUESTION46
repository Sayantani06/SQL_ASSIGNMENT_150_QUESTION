Write an SQL query to report the customer
ids from the Customer table that bought all the products in the Product table. 
Return the result table in any order.

CREATE TABLE customer
(
  customer_id INT,
  product_key INT
);

CREATE TABLE product
(
  product_key INT,
  CONSTRAINT pk_product PRIMARY KEY(product_key)
);

INSERT INTO customer VALUES(1, 5);
INSERT INTO customer VALUES(2, 6);
INSERT INTO customer VALUES(3, 5);
INSERT INTO customer VALUES(3, 6);
INSERT INTO customer VALUES(1, 6);

INSERT INTO product VALUES(5);
INSERT INTO product VALUES(6);

Select customer_id from (SELECT CUSTOMER_ID,
RANK() OVER(partition by CUSTOMER_ID order by product_key) as count_of_product from customer) temp 
where count_of_product=2;
