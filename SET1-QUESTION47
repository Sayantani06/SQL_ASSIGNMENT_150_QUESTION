Write an SQL query that reports the most experienced employees in each project. 
In case of a tie, report all employees with the maximum number of experience years. 
Return the result table in any order.



CREATE TABLE project
(
  project_id INT,
  employee_id INT,
  CONSTRAINT pk_project PRIMARY KEY(project_id, employee_id)
);

CREATE TABLE employee
(
  employee_id INT,
  name VARCHAR(30),
  experience_years INT,
  CONSTRAINT pk_employee PRIMARY KEY(employee_id)
);

INSERT INTO project VALUES(1, 1);
INSERT INTO project VALUES(1, 2);
INSERT INTO project VALUES(1, 3);
INSERT INTO project VALUES(2, 1);
INSERT INTO project VALUES(2, 4);

INSERT INTO employee VALUES(1, 'Khaled', 3);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(2, 'Ali', 2);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(3, 'John', 3);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(4, 'Doe', 2);


SELECT PROJECT_ID,EMPLOYEE_ID FROM
(SELECT PROJECT.PROJECT_ID AS PROJECT_ID ,PROJECT.EMPLOYEE_ID AS EMPLOYEE_ID,EMPLOYEE.EXPERIENCE_YEARS,
 RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY PROJECT.PROJECT_ID ORDER BY EMPLOYEE.EXPERIENCE_YEARS DESC) AS EXP_YEARS 
 FROM PROJECT LEFT JOIN EMPLOYEE
 ON EMPLOYEE.EMPLOYEE_ID = PROJECT.EMPLOYEE_ID) TEMP WHERE EXP_YEARS=1;
