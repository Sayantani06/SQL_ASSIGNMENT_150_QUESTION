Write an SQL query to report the respective department name and number of students majoring in each department for all departments in
the Department table (even ones with no current students). 
Return the result table ordered by student_number in descending order. In case of a tie, order them by dept_name alphabetically



CREATE TABLE department
(
  dept_id INT,
  dept_name VARCHAR(30),
  CONSTRAINT pk_department PRIMARY KEY(dept_id)
);

CREATE TABLE student
(
  student_id INT,
  student_name VARCHAR(30),
  gender VARCHAR(1),
  dept_id INT,
  CONSTRAINT pk_student PRIMARY KEY(student_id),
  CONSTRAINT fk_department FOREIGN KEY (dept_id)
    REFERENCES department(dept_id) 
);

INSERT INTO department VALUES(1, 'Engineering');
INSERT INTO department VALUES(2, 'Science');
INSERT INTO department VALUES(3, 'Law');

INSERT INTO student VALUES(1, 'Jack', 'M', 1);
INSERT INTO student VALUES(2, 'Jane', 'F', 1);
INSERT INTO student VALUES(3, 'Mark', 'M', 2);


SELECT DEPARTMENT.DEPT_NAME,COUNT(STUDENT.STUDENT_ID)
 FROM DEPARTMENT LEFT JOIN STUDENT 
 ON DEPARTMENT.DEPT_ID = STUDENT.DEPT_ID 
 GROUP BY DEPARTMENT.DEPT_NAME;
